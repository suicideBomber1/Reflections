Q : When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A : When I just want to show my code to others who want to contribute to it or others who want to review it. Also, I can edit my
    code anywhere.
    
Q : Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
    your remote repository?
A : Errors might also get crept in without me noticing.

Q : Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
A : Fork is getting a copy of it in your GitHub repo.It is just a virtual copy in your account. Clone is downloading the file 
    into your local system. Branche is just another wing to try out some new features and later merging them with the master.

Q : What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A : To know the state upto which commit is the remote inline with master.

Q : When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  
  What benefits does each approach have?
A : When working alone I tend to do everything in the master itself. But, while colloborating it is easy to keep track of things
   while working in branches and finally merging them with approved changes.
